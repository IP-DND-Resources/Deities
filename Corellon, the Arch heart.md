# Corellon, the Arch Heart
The moonlight paints silver across the quiet glade. A brush hovers above a canvas, changing the world with every stroke. A spell weaves its light through the air like music. A reflection shifts not with deception, but with truth. That shimmer of transformation, that heartbeat of inspiration. That is Corellon.

They are the Arch Heart, god of art, magic, and change. Patron of the elves, the fey, and all who see the world not as it is, but as it could be. Corellon is the first breath of creation, the sacred spark of identity, the courage to be different and to celebrate it.

To walk in Corellon’s light is to reject the stagnant and the cruel. It is to challenge what is fixed, to make beauty in defiance of despair. Their followers are mages, dancers, rebels, and dreamers. They bear no single form or path; only the truth of their own becoming.

You will not find Corellon in the echo of sermons or in laws etched in stone. You will find them in shifting reflections, in the curve of a blade mid-duel, in a symphony that changes every time it’s played. Their shrines are carved into moonlit cliffs, hidden in traveling circuses, whispered in enchanted verse.

Corellon does not command worship, they invite you to create. Shape yourself and shape your world, and when the world tells you what you cannot be answer it with something beautiful.

### Your Role in the World
As a follower of Corellon, you are an artist, a mystic, a bearer of change. You walk a world that too often forgets beauty and remind it, not with sermons, but with spells, song, and transformation.

You may adventure to inspire, to challenge tyranny, or simply to express the truth of who you are. Your magic does not just mend or destroy; it creates. It shapes the world into something more fluid, more free.

You are the light that dances on still water. You are the hand that remakes what others call finished.

And when you pass through a place, its lines are softer, its boundaries thinner. Someone there perhaps, dares to change.

### Signs of Their Favor
A shimmer of moonlight in shadowed halls. A melody heard by no one else. A breeze that stirs only your cloak. Their symbol is a crescent moon, a shifting reflection, or a star that twinkles at the right moment.

### Relationships

Corellon, alongside Avandra, Melora, and Sehanine, is counted among the Free Gods; deities who value autonomy, expression, and the unshackled potential of mortals. Their bond with Sehanine is the deepest, often portrayed as a divine romance full of mystery, trust, and shared rebellion. Together, they shaped the beauty of the world, moonlight and magic, dreams and creation, hand in hand.


The feud between Corellon and Gruumsh is ancient; born not just of war, but of opposing visions for the world. Corellon is the god of beauty, freedom, and art; Gruumsh is the god of conquest, rage, and destruction. Where Corellon shapes, Gruumsh scars.

In many elven myths, it is said that Gruumsh sought to claim dominion over the first mortal races, and when the gods contested this, Corellon stood against him. In the battle that followed, Corellon struck out Gruumsh’s eye. An act that earned them the orc god’s eternal hatred. This moment gave rise to Gruumsh’s infamous title: One-Eye.

Gruumsh in turn has tried, time and again, to destroy Corellon’s works: the elven people, the Feywild, and the very notion of beauty without obedience. Their conflict plays out endlessly across the mortal world in the form of clashes between elves and orcs, but the battle is more than racial, it is a war between freedom and domination, creation and conquest.

To Corellon’s faithful, Gruumsh is not just an enemy, but a warning: of what becomes of gods who destroy what they cannot control.

### Lore
#### Corellon and Lolth
Once, Corellon and Lolth were kin; fellow members of the elven pantheon, possibly even lovers or close companions in some myths. Lolth, then known as Araushnee, was the Weaver of Destiny, a goddess of twilight and ambition. Together with Corellon and Sehanine, she helped shape the elves and the magic of the world.

But Lolth craved power beyond the bounds of art or freedom. She grew resentful of Corellon’s fluid nature and sought dominion over elvenkind, believing herself the rightful ruler. In the ancient wars between gods, she betrayed Corellon, leading to a cataclysmic conflict among the elven deities.

This betrayal culminated in Lolth cursing Corellon’s children. Warping many elves into the drow, casting them into the Underdark, and painting them as corrupt. Corellon, wounded by this loss, refuses to view the drow as damned, instead holding hope for their redemption and return to the surface.

Today, Corellon’s hatred for Lolth is absolute, not born of vengeance, but of heartbreak. For what was lost, what was twisted, and what might still be healed.

#### The Cracked Mask
In a forgotten city ruled by a tyrant who banned art, music, and magic, a masked stranger arrived at the gates. The guards laughed because the law was strict, and such things were death offenses. But the stranger did not speak. They danced.

With each step, the streets cracked. With each twirl, the gray stone walls bloomed into color. The tyrant ordered them executed, but no blade could strike true. The stranger changed form faster than the eye. When at last the mask fell, there was no face beneath it, only starlight.

That night, the people rose, and the city changed. They say the stranger still dances on rooftops, wherever expression is chained.

#### Work Yet Completed
A sculptor, weary from years of work, came to a moonlit glade and cried out to the Arch Heart, “What is my true form? I have carved a hundred faces, worn a thousand masks, and still I do not know myself.”

Corellon appeared in the shimmer of starlight, neither man nor woman, neither still nor changing. They placed a chisel in the sculptor’s hand and said, “You are not meant to find your final form. You are meant to shape it, again and again.”

The sculptor looked down and saw the marble block before them was warm, already beginning to pulse with their heartbeat. And so they began again, smiling.
