# Sarenrae, the Everlight
The desert holds its breath before the dawn. A final star flickers against the coming blaze. A prayer is whispered in the hush, not for victory, but for peace. A blade is cleaned, not from bloodlust, but from duty. Then the first light crests the horizon, golden and warm. The darkness flees not in fear, but in release. That is Sarenrae.

She is the Everlight: goddess of healing, redemption, and the fire that cleanses. She walks where hope flickers low, where cruelty has left scars too deep for mortal balm. Her hands offer mercy, her eyes weep for those who turn it away, and her flame is patient, until it must burn.

To follow Sarenrae is to believe that the broken can be mended, that even the vilest shadow once had light. Her path is not soft; it is radiant and raw, demanding courage greater than hatred. Her followers are healers and redeemers, paladins with weeping eyes, exiles turned protectors. They hold no illusions, only the will to choose grace even when the world offers blood.

You will not find Sarenrae in vengeance. You will find her in the hand that lifts a fallen foe, in the healer who stays behind, in the candle lit for someone who never said “sorry.” Her temples are built with open roofs and open hearts. Her doctrine is whispered in every sunrise and every act of forgiveness that could have been wrath.

Sarenrae does not promise safety, she offers a choice; Be the light. Even when it hurts.

### A Follower’s Flame
You are not perfect. You are not meant to be. You are meant to rise.

In the Everlight’s gaze, your past does not chain you. Every wound you carry, every failure you regret is kindling and from it, you burn brighter. You are the proof that change is possible. That fire can be mercy and that even when the world chooses cruelty, you can answer with grace.

You are the light in the darkened hall, a flame that does not falter, a hand that does not strike, until it must.

Let others mock your hope. Let them say the world cannot be redeemed. Then prove them wrong with every life you save, every enemy you spare, every wrong you set right, even when it breaks your heart, because the dawn always comes, and you are already shining.

### Signs of Her Favor
The warmth that lingers long after the fire has died. A golden ray of light breaking through stormclouds. The hush before sunrise, where the world feels held. A wound that closes without a scar. Her symbol appears in halos of sunlit dust, in the gleam of polished brass, or in flames that flicker but do not consume. A voice in your heart says: “Try again.”

### Followers and Champions
Those who walk the Everlight’s path are varied: former criminals seeking redemption, soldiers disillusioned by war, or gentle souls called to heal. Many adventuring clerics or paladins of Sarenrae bear emotional wounds they hope to one day cleanse, in themselves or the world.

### Relationships
###### Asmodeus, Lord of the Hells
Sarenrae once tried to redeem the Prince of Hell, and failed. Legends say she offered him mercy at the beginning of time, and he mocked her kindness as weakness. Since then, she has become one of his few true enemies who mourns what he could have been.

###### Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon
Sarenrae and Bahamut are often portrayed as kindred spirits: one the flame of redemption, the other the law of justice. Their followers often work together in quests to topple tyrants or protect the innocent. Some tales describe them as celestial allies in the Dawn War, and in mortal terms, they represent mercy and law as two halves of righteous purpose.

###### Pelor, the Dawnfather	
Where Pelor is the harsh noon sun of righteousness, Sarenrae is the healing dawn; gentler, closer, and more forgiving. Their shared dominion over light, healing, and justice makes them natural allies. Sarenrae is the light that rises. Pelor is the light that rules. She is the mercy of the dawn. He is the authority of day.

###### Avandra, the Changebringer
Both goddesses are champions of freedom, hope, and the transformative power of choice. Where Sarenrae offers redemption through compassion, Avandra brings liberation through change. Their friendship is one of light hearts and deeper purpose: the flame that heals and the wind that moves onward.

### Lore

#### The First Dawn
Long before mortal memory, Sarenrae kindled the first sunrise with a single breath, casting light into the void and offering warmth to a world that had never known it. She wept for the cruelty she saw grow beneath that light, but still she held out her hand, even to gods who spat in her mercy. It was her blade that struck first against the Betrayers, not in hatred, but sorrow, for she knew some fires must burn to heal. Her faithful say she still walks unseen at the edge of every battlefield, offering peace before the sword, and light before the end. When the sun breaks through after the longest night, they say that is her answer: not wrath, but hope, still rising.

#### The Flame of Redemption
Legends speak of Sarenrae walking among mortals in disguise, offering chances to those on the edge. In one such tale, she spent seven years as a healer in a warlord’s camp, changing the hearts of warriors one by one until peace was brokered. Not by blades, but by forgiveness.

#### The Fall of the Tharizdun

When Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion rose to devour all creation, it was Sarenrae who first lifted her blade, her fire burning brighter than the world's fear. She did not strike out of hatred, but with a sorrowful heart, knowing that mercy had been refused and the world left no other path. Her flame scorched the earth as she helped bind him beneath the world, a scar that even time could not fully heal. In the Age of Arcanum, when the Betrayer Gods turned on their kin, it was again Sarenrae who stood in judgment, casting the Chained Oblivion into darkness, though it nearly shattered her. And still, to this day, her followers say she grieves not for the evil she destroyed, but for the good it might once have been.
