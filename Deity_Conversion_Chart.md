This document matches all **Prime Deities** and **Betrayer Gods** from *Exandria* with their closest equivalents in the *Forgotten Realms* (FR) pantheon. Each entry includes alignment, domains, roles, and a brief summary for use in D&D 5E (2024).

**Note:** Many Exandria deities derive from the Dawn War pantheon, which is shared with Forgotten Realms. Where no exact match exists (e.g., Sarenrae), the closest thematic FR equivalent is listed.
