# Avandra, the Changebringer
The wind carries the scent of new lands and the promise of change. It dances through the hair of the wanderer, whispers to the restless soul, and rustles the prayer flags tied to an old oak at the crossroads. That wind is Avandra. 

She is the goddess of change, freedom, and luck. Beloved by travelers, merchants, gamblers, and those who seek a better life. To walk in Avandra’s light is to believe that the world is not fixed. Tyranny can be broken, chains can fall, and no path is ever closed to those with courage in their heart and wind at their back.

Avandra is no stern matron of stone temples. Her sanctuaries are campsites beneath starlight, inns filled with laughter, and hidden shrines tucked beside roads less traveled. Her clerics are not cloistered, they are moving, always bringing hope, luck, and liberation wherever they go.

Avandra does not demand worship in rigid rituals. Instead, she asks that you live boldly and encourage others to do the same. Flip a coin to make a choice. Walk a different road. Trust in your luck, and when luck fails, be the reason things turn around.


### Your Role in the World
As a follower of Avandra, you are a guide, a liberator, a symbol of freedom’s hope. You may travel with adventurers to right wrongs, explore the unknown, or simply follow the call of a better tomorrow. Your magic uplifts the downtrodden, breaks barriers, and turns the tide at just the right moment.

You are the storm that stirs the stagnant air. You are the voice that says, “It doesn’t have to be this way.”
And when you walk away, the world is never quite the same.

### Signs of Her Favor
A sudden lucky break. A coin landing just right. The right road appearing when you feared you were lost. Her symbol is a butterfly, a rising breeze, or a hand casting dice.

### Relationships

Avandra, together with Corellon, Melora and Sehanine, constitute the four deites known as the free gods. Their cooperation grew from their earlier relationships and the connection some of them had with the race of the halflings. The free gods objected to turning the astral dominion of Carceri into a prison, and worked to obtain a different solution.

Avandra is considered one of the three gods of destiny, together with Ioun, and the Raven Queen. She is said to hate Zehir the most. She is an opponent of Asmodeus and Torog.

Avandra has taken no exarch into her service in ages. She chooses to interact directly with her followers, and she guides her mortal servants to battle against her enemies—not out of any sort of personal cowardice, but because she believes in allowing mortals to solve their own problems. 

### Lore
#### Avandra and the halflings
According to halfling legend, Melora and Sehanine created the halflings together, giving the race a love of nature and the gift of stealth. When their interest waned, Melora and Sehanine stopped looking after the race, or so the legends go, and halflings made their own way in the world. They say Avandra, the god of luck, admired their resourcefulness and adopted them, favoring them with good fortune. Not all halflings worship Avandra, but nearly all breathe a prayer of thanks to her when fortune favors them.
Avandra and the first doppelganger

#### Avandra and the first doppelganger
When the world was young, Avandra was deeply involved in the lives of its creatures. She delighted in making their lives better. One mortal who was the object of Avandra's favor was a beautiful woman who was pursued by a cruel suitor. This suitor set his servants on her like hunting dogs. Two times Avandra helped the woman to flee or fight by changing her luck, and each time the woman praised Avandra after her escape.

The third time the woman was threatened, Avandra gifted her with the power to change her form so that she could save herself from any future threat. The woman used her power to become an assassin, killing her suitor and all who served him. When Avandra sought her out to rebuke her, the woman used her power to hide from the goddess. By the time Avandra found the woman, her children's children had given birth to many more offspring, all having the power to change shape. The goddess's gift, once given, could not be taken away. Thus the race of doppelgangers and their descendants, the changelings, were born.

From that episode Avandra learned a bitter lesson about being overly generous to mortals. Ever since then, she has been careful to help mortals only in small ways, often hiding her hand. By allowing mortals to face their own problems, Avandra provides them with the chance to discover their full potential.
The Divine Compromises

#### The Divine Compromises
When the immortals had won the war against the primordials, they fought among themselves for dominion over various aspects of the natural world. Zehir contested with Pelor over mastery of the sky, for the sun banished darkness. Pelor in turn fought with Khala, whose icy mists and snows blocked the life-giving rays of the sun. Each of Pelor's opponents gathered allies, and Pelor had allies of his own. On one side stood Corellon, Khala, Zehir, and Sehanine, while on the other stood Pelor, Erathis, Moradin, and Melora. The two forces argued for ages to no avail, leaving hurts and grudges that linger still.

At last Avandra parlayed between the two factions. To settle the argument between Pelor and Zehir, she offered day and night. As a compromise between Khala and Pelor, she proposed alternating seasons of summer and winter. The gods, weary of their quarrels, agreed. Pelor abides faithfully by his agreement with Zehir, but from time to time Zehir seeks to shadow the sun during daytime with an eclipse. Khala is no more, but the Raven Queen-who holds sway over winter now-honors the ancient pact. Yet she also tests Pelor's resolve, seeking to end summers early and delaying springs as long as she can. In this way, autumn snows and spring thaws can come early or late.
